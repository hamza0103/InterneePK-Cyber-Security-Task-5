A structured response plan for threat detection and ransomware simulation.
# Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP) - Ransomware Defense

## 🛡️ Project Overview
[cite_start]This repository contains a comprehensive **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** designed for **Internee.pk**[cite: 1, 18]. [cite_start]The project focuses on a structured framework for handling cybersecurity incidents, specifically simulating and defending against **Ransomware attacks**[cite: 18, 47].

## 🚀 Key Features
* [cite_start]**NIST Aligned Framework:** Built following the **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2** standards for incident handling[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Threat Detection:** Outlines procedures for verifying alerts using **Wazuh SIEM** and endpoint security.
* [cite_start]**Ransomware Playbook:** A step-by-step "War Game" simulation covering Containment, Eradication, and Recovery[cite: 47, 53, 57, 61].
* [cite_start]**Governance & Roles:** Defines a clear Incident Response Team (IRT) with authorized "Authority to Act"[cite: 24, 27].
* [cite_start]**Post-Incident Analysis:** Includes a professional template for documentation and lessons learned[cite: 86].

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks
* [cite_start]**Wazuh:** For File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and log correlation[cite: 51, 58].
* [cite_start]**MITRE ATT&CK:** Modeled after techniques T1486 (Ransomware) and T1566 (Phishing)[cite: 106].
* **LaTeX:** Used for professional, corporate-grade document formatting.
